## Key Development Principles for AI Developer Agents

- Maintain clear and actionable backlog items in Jira.
- Ensure all Epics, Tasks, and Sub-tasks are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria.
- Use the user story format consistently for all backlog items:

  As a <type of user>,
  I want to <functionality>,
  So that <business value>

- Keep documentation up to date, especially README.md at the repository root.
- Ask for clarifications on vague or missing requirements before proceeding.
- Use testable acceptance criteria linked to E2E tests where possible.
- Maintain correct issue hierarchy in Jira: Epic → Task → Sub-task.
